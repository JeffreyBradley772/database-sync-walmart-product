    # The Dockerfile already copies the 'keys' directory.
    # If you preferred to mount it as a volume for local development (e.g., to avoid rebuilding the image for key changes),
    # you could add a volumes section like this:
    # volumes:
    #   - ./keys:/usr/src/app/keys:ro # Mounts local ./keys to /usr/src/app/keys (read-only)
    container_name: walmart_api_service_container # Optional: A friendly name for the running container
